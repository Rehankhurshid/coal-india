# Authentication and Group Creation Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Database Schema Issues**

- **Problem**: Missing foreign key relationships between messaging tables and employees table
- **Solution**: Added proper foreign key constraints with CASCADE delete to maintain referential integrity
- **Impact**: Ensures data consistency and enables proper JOIN operations

### 2. **Missing Columns**

- **Problem**: `read_by` column was missing from `messaging_messages` table
- **Solution**: Added `read_by` column as VARCHAR[] array to track message read status
- **Impact**: Enables unread message counting and read receipts

### 3. **Function Overloading Issues**

- **Problem**: Ambiguous function references in `get_user_groups` causing parameter type conflicts
- **Solution**:
  - Dropped all existing versions of the function
  - Created a clean version with TEXT parameter type
  - Fixed parameter naming to match the function signature
- **Impact**: Resolved PostgREST function lookup errors

### 4. **Data Integrity**

- **Problem**: Invalid employee IDs in messaging tables (orphaned records)
- **Solution**: Cleaned up invalid data before adding foreign key constraints
- **Impact**: Prevents future data integrity issues

## Database Migrations Applied

1. **Cleanup and Foreign Keys** (`cleanup_messaging_data_and_add_fkeys`)

   - Removed orphaned records
   - Added foreign key constraints for:
     - `messaging_messages.sender_id` → `employees.emp_code`
     - `messaging_group_members.employee_id` → `employees.emp_code`
     - `messaging_groups.created_by` → `employees.emp_code`

2. **Missing Columns and Functions** (`add_read_by_column_and_fix_functions`)
   - Added `read_by` column to track message read status
   - Fixed `get_user_groups` function with proper parameter naming
   - Added performance indexes

## Authentication Flow

1. **Login Process**:

   - User enters employee ID
   - System sends OTP via email
   - User verifies OTP
   - JWT token issued with 30-day validity
   - Refresh token stored in HTTP-only cookie

2. **Session Management**:

   - JWT stored in HTTP-only, secure cookie
   - Automatic token refresh on API calls
   - User context set for Row Level Security (RLS)

3. **Protected Routes**:
   - All messaging endpoints require authentication
   - User membership verified for group access
   - RLS policies enforce data isolation

## Group Creation Process

1. **API Endpoint**: POST `/api/messaging/groups`
2. **Authentication**: Required (JWT validation)
3. **Process**:
   - Validate user authentication
   - Create group with user as creator
   - Add creator as admin automatically
   - Add additional members if provided
   - Return enriched group data

## Test Page Created

Created `/test-group-creation-auth` page that:

- Shows authentication status
- Allows group creation with real-time feedback
- Displays test results for each step
- Lists user's existing groups
- Sends test message to verify functionality

## Security Features

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**:

   - User context set via `set_config('app.current_user', user_id)`
   - Policies restrict data access to authorized users

2. **Foreign Key Constraints**:

   - Prevent orphaned records
   - Maintain referential integrity
   - CASCADE deletes for cleanup

3. **Authentication Middleware**:
   - Validates JWT on every request
   - Refreshes tokens automatically
   - Logs authentication attempts

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**:

   - Use the test page at `/test-group-creation-auth` to verify group creation
   - Check that messages can be sent/received
   - Verify unread counts work correctly

2. **Monitoring**:

   - Watch server logs for any errors
   - Check that foreign key constraints are enforced
   - Verify RLS policies are working

3. **Performance**:
   - Added indexes for better query performance
   - Function-based group fetching for efficiency
   - Caching opportunities for frequently accessed data

## How to Test

1. Go to `/test-group-creation-auth`
2. Ensure you're logged in (redirect to login if not)
3. Create a group with a name
4. Optionally add member IDs
5. Click "Create Group"
6. Verify the group appears in your groups list
7. Check that a test message was sent successfully

The system now has robust authentication with proper database constraints, efficient queries, and comprehensive error handling.
