# Message Attachments Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The messaging system now supports file attachments (images, PDFs, documents, etc.) with a 15MB size limit per file.

## Key Components

### 1. Database Schema

- **Table**: `message_attachments`
- **Storage Bucket**: `message-attachments` (public)
- **Columns**:
  - `id` (uuid, primary key)
  - `message_id` (uuid, foreign key)
  - `group_id` (integer, foreign key)
  - `uploaded_by` (text, foreign key)
  - `file_name` (text)
  - `file_type` (text)
  - `file_size` (bigint)
  - `file_path` (text)
  - `public_url` (text)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)

### 2. API Endpoints

#### Upload Endpoint

- **Path**: `/api/messaging/upload`
- **Method**: POST
- **Input**: FormData with file and groupId
- **Features**:
  - 15MB file size limit
  - Supported file types: images, PDFs, documents, archives, media
  - Automatic unique filename generation
  - Group membership verification
  - Returns attachment metadata and public URL

#### Message Send with Attachments

- **Path**: `/api/messaging/groups/[id]/messages`
- **Method**: POST
- **Accepts**: attachmentIds array in request body
- \*\*Links attachments to the message

### 3. Frontend Components

#### ChatInput Component

- File selection button with paperclip icon
- Multiple file selection support
- Real-time upload progress indicators
- File preview with removal option
- Error handling for oversized/invalid files

#### MessageAttachment Component

- Displays attachments in messages
- Image preview with lightbox view
- PDF/document icons with download links
- File size display
- Responsive layout

#### SimpleMsgBubble Component

- Integrated attachment display
- Maintains message flow with attachments

### 4. Features Implemented

✅ **File Upload**

- Multi-file selection

✅ **File Types Supported**

- Images: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP, SVG
- Documents: PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, TXT, CSV
- Archives: ZIP, RAR, 7Z
- Media: MP4, MPEG, MOV, MP3, WAV, WebM

✅ **Security**

- Authentication required
- Group membership verification
- Secure file paths with UUID
- Public URL generation

✅ **UI/UX**

- Clean attachment preview
- Upload progress indicators
- Error messages
- Responsive design
- Image lightbox view

## Testing the Feature

1. **Login** to the messaging app
2. **Select a group** from the sidebar
3. **Click the paperclip icon** in the message input
4. **Select files** (multiple files supported)
5. **Wait for upload** to complete
6. **Type a message** (optional)
7. **Send** the message

## Error Handling

- **File too large**: Shows error message with file size
- **Invalid file type**: Lists allowed file types
- **Upload failure**: Displays error and allows retry
- **Network issues**: Handled gracefully with error messages

## Storage Structure

Files are stored in Supabase Storage with the following path structure:

```
message-attachments/
└── messaging/
    └── {groupId}/
        └── {uuid}.{extension}
```

## Performance Considerations

- Files are uploaded before message is sent
- Parallel upload support for multiple files
- Public URLs for direct access
- No authentication required for viewing (public bucket)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Drag and drop file upload
- Image compression before upload
- Video thumbnails
- File type specific previews
- Attachment search functionality
- Bulk download options

## Development Notes

- The feature integrates seamlessly with the existing real-time messaging system
- Attachments are displayed in both sender and receiver views
- The system maintains message order even with large attachments
- All components are TypeScript-safe with proper interfaces

## Deployment Checklist

1. ✅ Database migrations applied
2. ✅ Storage bucket created and configured
3. ✅ API endpoints deployed
4. ✅ Frontend components integrated
5. ✅ Error handling implemented
6. ✅ Security measures in place

The attachment feature is now fully functional and ready for production use.
