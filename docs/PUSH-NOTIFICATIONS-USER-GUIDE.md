# Push Notifications User Guide

## Overview

The Coal India messaging app supports PWA push notifications to alert users when they receive new messages, even when the app is not open.

## How Push Notifications Work

1. **Automatic Notifications**: When someone sends you a message in a group, you'll receive a push notification on your device
2. **Click to Open**: Clicking the notification will open the messaging app and take you to the conversation
3. **Works Everywhere**: Notifications work on desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and mobile devices (iOS 16.4+, Android)

## Enabling Push Notifications

### Step 1: Look for the Bell Icon

In the messaging app, look for the bell icon in the chat header (top right area).

### Step 2: Click to Enable

- **Bell with line through it** (ðŸ”•): Notifications are OFF - click to enable
- **Bell** (ðŸ””): Notifications are ON - click to disable

### Step 3: Grant Permission

When you first enable notifications, your browser will ask for permission:

- Click "Allow" to enable notifications
- If you click "Block", you'll need to manually enable them in browser settings
