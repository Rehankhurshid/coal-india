4. **API Endpoints**

   - POST `/api/messaging/upload` - Upload files

5. **Real-time Support**
   - Attachments included in real-time message updates
   - Proper cleanup on message deletion

## Database Schema

### message_attachments table

```sql
CREATE TABLE message_attachments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    message_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES messaging_messages(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    file_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_size INTEGER NOT NULL,
    storage_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    public_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### RPC Function

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_group_messages_with_names(
  p_group_id integer,
  p_limit integer DEFAULT 50,
  p_offset integer DEFAULT 0
)
-- Returns messages with attachments as JSON
```

## Usage

### Sending a message with attachments:

1. Select files using the attachment button or drag & drop
2. Files are uploaded immediately with progress indicators
3. Send the message - attachments are linked automatically

### Viewing attachments:

- Images show inline previews (click to view full size)
- Other files show with icons and download on click
- File sizes are displayed in human-readable format

## Security

- File size limit: 15MB per file
- File type validation on both client and server
- Proper authentication checks
- Users can only delete their own attachments

## Testing

The feature has been tested with:

- Single and multiple file uploads
- Various file types
- Large files (up to 15MB)
- Real-time message updates
- Error handling scenarios

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements:

1. Add file compression for images
2. Generate thumbnails for better performance
3. Add virus scanning for uploaded files
4. Implement file preview for more document types
5. Add support for audio/video streaming

## Implementation Details

All code changes are documented in the following files:

- `src/app/api/messaging/upload/route.ts` - Upload endpoint
- `src/app/api/messaging/attachments/[id]/route.ts` - Delete endpoint
- `src/components/messaging/message-attachment.tsx` - Attachment display
- `src/components/messaging/chat-input.tsx` - File selection UI
