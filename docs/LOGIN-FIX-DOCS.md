## Problem

During development, users were getting "Employee not found" error during OTP verification because:

1. The database `employees` table was empty
2. No test employee data existed for development

## Solution Applied

### 1. Development Mode Auto-Employee Creation

Modified `/src/app/api/auth/verify-otp/route.ts` to automatically create temporary employees in development mode when they don't exist in the database.

### 2. Test Employee SQL Script

Created `test-employees.sql` with sample employee data:

- `TEST001` - Test Employee One
- `ADMIN` - Admin User
- `DEV001` - Developer One

## How to Use

### Method 1: Quick Development Testing

1. Use any Employee ID (e.g., `TESTUSER`, `ADMIN`, `DEV001`)
2. The system will automatically create a temporary employee in development mode
3. Use OTP: `123456` (development bypass)

### Method 2: Proper Database Setup

1. Run the SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   -- Contents of test-employees.sql
   ```
2. Use one of the predefined employee IDs: `TEST001`, `ADMIN`, `DEV001`
3. Use OTP: `123456` (development bypass)

## Development Features

- ✅ Automatic temporary employee creation
- ✅ OTP bypass with `123456` in development
- ✅ Console logging for debugging
- ✅ Graceful fallback if database operations fail

## Testing Credentials

- **Employee ID**: Any string (auto-created) or `TEST001`/`ADMIN`/`DEV001`
- **OTP**: `123456`
- **Environment**: Development mode only
