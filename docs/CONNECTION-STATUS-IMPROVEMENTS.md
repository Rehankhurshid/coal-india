# Connection Status Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to the connection status indicators in the messaging application to make them more reliable and efficient.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Connection Status Hook (`src/hooks/use-connection-status.ts`)

- Added connection states: 'connected', 'connecting', 'disconnected'
- Implemented exponential backoff for reconnection attempts (max 5 retries)
- Added debouncing for status changes (500ms) to prevent flickering
- Better network monitoring using both online/offline events and ping mechanism
- Clear separation between network availability (isOnline) and server connectivity (isConnected)

### 2. Improved Connection Status Component (`src/components/connection-status.tsx`)

- Shows different states: Online, Connecting (with animation), Offline, Reconnecting
- Displays reconnection attempts count when reconnecting
- Smooth transitions between states
- Consistent visual feedback across all connection states

### 3. Updated Components

- **DesktopSidebar**: Now accepts `connectionStatus` prop for more detailed status
- **ChatArea**: Uses connection status to show appropriate messages and disable input
- **EnhancedMessagingApp**: Monitors connection status changes and shows toast notifications

### 4. Connection State Logic

- Consolidated connection status management in `useConnectionStatus` hook
- Removed conflicting `isConnected` states from multiple sources
- Clear priority: Network availability first, then server connectivity

## Benefits

1. **Better User Feedback**: Users see exactly what's happening with their connection
2. **Reduced Confusion**: Clear distinction between offline (no internet) and disconnected (server issue)
3. **Smoother Experience**: Debouncing prevents status flickering during unstable connections
4. **Automatic Recovery**: Exponential backoff ensures efficient reconnection attempts

## Visual States

### Online (Connected)

- Green circle with "Online" text
- Everything works normally

### Connecting

- Yellow circle with animated pulse
- Shows "Connecting..." text
- Input is disabled but visible

### Offline

- Red circle with "Offline" text
- Shows overlay on chat input
- Clear message about checking internet connection

### Reconnecting

- Orange circle with "Reconnecting" text
- Shows attempt count (e.g., "Reconnecting (2/5)")
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

## Technical Details

### Connection Check Mechanism

```typescript
// Ping server every 30 seconds when online
// Check connectivity to actual API endpoint
// Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s (max 5 attempts)
```

### State Management

```typescript
type ConnectionStatus = "connected" | "connecting" | "disconnected";

interface UseConnectionStatus {
  isOnline: boolean; // Network availability
  isConnected: boolean; // Server connectivity
  connectionStatus: ConnectionStatus;
  reconnectAttempts: number;
}
```

## Testing the Connection Status

1. **Test Offline Mode**:

   - Turn off WiFi/network
   - Should show "Offline" status immediately
   - Chat input should be disabled with overlay

2. **Test Server Disconnection**:

   - Keep network on but block API endpoint
   - Should show "Reconnecting" with attempt counter
   - Should eventually give up after 5 attempts

3. **Test Recovery**:

   - Go offline then back online
   - Should automatically reconnect
   - Should show "Connection restored" toast

4. **Test Flaky Connection**:
   - Rapidly toggle network on/off
   - Status should not flicker due to debouncing
   - Should handle gracefully without errors
